# Status table

| From | To | Allowed |
|---|---|---|
| New | InProgress | Yes |
| InProgress | Resolved | Yes |
| New | Resolved | No |
| Resolved | New | No |

# Forbidden — why

- New → Resolved is forbidden because a new case must be processed before it can be resolved.
- Resolved → New is forbidden because a resolved case cannot directly return to the new state.
